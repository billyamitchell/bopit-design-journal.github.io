            <p>30 minute toy designs from childhood<br>
I made a simple joint for two objects that was inspired by the tactile aspects of playing with legos I had as a kid. I wanted to replicate the *snap* that I found satisfying when I was younger and still do today. I used a plastic connection for the joint in order to provide the right feel to the point of connection. I used a soft mdf wood that was rounded off on one side to provide something that was nice to hold onto and manipulate the joint with your hands.<br>Class input:</p>

            <h2>Thursday // 2.28.19</h2>
            <p>We built a robotic creature with lego wedo, that has 4 wheels to move, and uses a sensor to perceive obstacles in its path. It was programmed using basic commands in scratch.<br>
V1:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>used two motors</li>
            <li>could turn and navigate with all 4 arrow keys</li>
            <li>fun interactive controls</li>
            <li>Explore the room</li>
        </ul>
V2:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>used one motor and a distance sensor on the second port</li>
            <li>Could only move forward and back</li>
            <ul>
                <li>But, can sense obstacles in front, respond to obstacles</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Further programming possibilities through scratch</li>
        </ul>
Zanaya:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>People playing against each other</li>
            <li>Physical obstacles: things to drive over, etc</li>
        </ul>




Possible gameplay:
“Storm the Castle!”
You control a robotic creature, on a path of destruction toward the castle where a bunch of evil landlords reside. But before you reach the castle, you encounter challenges in your path. Defeat your enemies and conquer the lands!

On the board, the robot starts on the furthest space from the castle. Several enemies (standing paper cards) are placed on the spaces between the robot and the castle. In order to progress forward an reach the castle, each enemy must be knocked down using the projectile launcher on the robot. You can only use the launcher if you have defeated the enemy on the virtual encounter (short game on scratch).
If the launcher is used and knocks over an enemy, the robot will still not progress because it needs the power it collects from the in game challenge (concept/game mechanic in progress)

            <p>ROBIONS GAMEPLAY:<br>
                Who is it for?<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Young Adult (Age 15-18) -- or younger?</li>
                <li>Interested in strategy games</li>
            </ul>

What is it?<br>
            <ul>
                <li>A turn based strategy game that takes place between 4 players/robots (1-4 people + AI) on a modular tile board.</li>
                <li>The goal is to dominate the board and convert every robot to your side</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is a environmental/ecological component to the world that is illustrated on the tiles, woven into the story/goal, and visualized through the encounters.</li>
                    <li>The tiles have 2 groups: ecological and industrial</li>
                    <li>A “side” may constitute a ecological/industrial leaning faction of the robot.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Every turn, every player chooses their next move on the app interface. After everyone is finished, watch as all of the robots move at once on the board.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Players can move 1 tile at a time</li>
                    <li>Players can choose which direction if multiple directions are available</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Upon conquering a new tile, the robot acquires resources from that tile based on the tile environment (e.g. if it is an eco tile, the robot acquires more eco related items and abilities)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you encounter an enemy (other player) on the same tile, the environment of the tile gives and advantage to the respective items in player inventory.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>


Based on feedback:<br>
Focus more on the physical gameplay. I think that the app could still be a part of this, but the focus should be on the game board.
            <ul>
                <li>Take away the map part of the app, simplify app</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Thursday // 3.7.2019</h2>
            <p>The game board has been prototyped, and the size looks good and the variety of tiles is nice. A good variety of map layouts can be achieved with the current tile count and shapes. I think the relationship between the size of the robots and the size of the tiles will be interesting. Most board games have relatively small pieces for the board that they are played on. I think it would be cool/visually engaging if the robots were rather large and became a sort of moving/animated part of the board.<br>
From a first simulated playthrough, I think that this is a good start for what might become a more complex game in further iterations. I think that more thought needs to be put into what the individual attachments do. In order to improve gameplay diversity, I think attachments that add abilities like an additional movement distance (like a head attachment), versus purely combative attachments (like arms) would be a really interesting component that pushes the players to consider their strategy against the other players.<br>
The size of the board is also an interesting component that will have a large impact on the gameplay. A smaller board, like the prototype pictured, will force players to be very resourceful in their first movements. Players will pick up their attachments quickly, and a decisive move will likely decide the rest of the game. A larger board will encourage a little more exploration in the first stage of the game. A player can plan further ahead, and can prioritize their own preferences in the construction of their robot. This also affects a player’s strategy in picking their fights: if another player has certain attachments that would give them the advantage, one might decide to avoid that player until they are fully prepared to fight.<br>

Smaller board:
            <ul>
                <li>Short games</li>
                <li>Decisive moves</li>
                <li>You get what you get... board layout has greater impact on game</li>
            </ul>

Larger board:
            <ul>
                <li>Long games</li>
                <li>Cat and mouse</li>
                <li>Customization of robot</li>
            </ul>

Ideas:
            <ul>
                <li>Add an additional resource besides attachments</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diversify strategy and gameplay</li>
                    <li>Take over the map! → more potential for incorporating the story/world-building</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Points (resource?) that may decide game → player that reaches point cap wins</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce cat and mouse gameplay, encourage fighting</li>
                </ul>
                <li>This game needs an excitement factor… (or maybe it needs strong strategy gameplay at its core?)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>More tension with strategy</li>
                    <li>Have the pieces fly off when a player is defeated</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

                <p>This game is going through quite an evolution. In short, we have refined the Robions game to be more simple and easy to understand. We have also developed a nearely completely separate board game in tandem with the original. The second board game drops many of the narrative driven elements of Robions, but, it is significantly more easily understood, better paced, and simply more entertaining to play. It is still a turn based game and uses the same hexagonal board; however, many of the game mechanics are new. This game was spawned in our attempt to highlight and focus on our favorite parts of our past iterations.<br>
                I will make a detailed write up of the mechanics of each game as they are developed further.
