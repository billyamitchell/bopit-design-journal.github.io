            <p>30 minute toy designs from childhood<br>
I made a simple joint for two objects that was inspired by the tactile aspects of playing with legos I had as a kid. I wanted to replicate the *snap* that I found satisfying when I was younger and still do today. I used a plastic connection for the joint in order to provide the right feel to the point of connection. I used a soft mdf wood that was rounded off on one side to provide something that was nice to hold onto and manipulate the joint with your hands.<br>Class input:</p>
        <ul style="none">
            <li>It functions like a fidget toy</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Has become enormously popular in the past few years</li>
                <li>A tactile and satisfying way to distract your hands</li>
                <li>Anxiety, a physical way of releasing some emotion</li>
                <li>Visible to people around you</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Make more ways of connecting</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Different types of joints on the same object</li>
                <li>Different forms of manipulating the joints</li>

            <li>Sound</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Moving and manipulating creates sound</li>

            <h2>Thursday</h2>
            <p>We built a robotic creature with lego wedo, that has 4 wheels to move, and uses a sensor to perceive obstacles in its path. It was programmed using basic commands in scratch.<br>
V1:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>used two motors</li>
            <li>could turn and navigate with all 4 arrow keys</li>
            <li>fun interactive controls</li>
            <li>Explore the room</li>
        </ul>
V2:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>used one motor and a distance sensor on the second port</li>
            <li>Could only move forward and back</li>
            <ul>
                <li>But, can sense obstacles in front, respond to obstacles</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Further programming possibilities through scratch</li>
        </ul>
Zanaya:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>People playing against each other</li>
            <li>Physical obstacles: things to drive over, etc</li>
        </ul>




Possible gameplay:
“Storm the Castle!”
You control a robotic creature, on a path of destruction toward the castle where a bunch of evil landlords reside. But before you reach the castle, you encounter challenges in your path. Defeat your enemies and conquer the lands!

On the board, the robot starts on the furthest space from the castle. Several enemies (standing paper cards) are placed on the spaces between the robot and the castle. In order to progress forward an reach the castle, each enemy must be knocked down using the projectile launcher on the robot. You can only use the launcher if you have defeated the enemy on the virtual encounter (short game on scratch).
If the launcher is used and knocks over an enemy, the robot will still not progress because it needs the power it collects from the in game challenge (concept/game mechanic in progress)
